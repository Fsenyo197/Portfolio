          Out of curiosity and my love for learning new things, I started learning python in 2019. My disire about tech sky-rocketed when i created and was managing a full-flesh blog site using wordpress even though i had no knowledge on its stacks. So i decided to learn HTML & CSS, and JavaScript in 2021. Just after finishing my self taught journey in 2022, I got an opportunity to join ALX-Africa powered by Holberton coding school in USA, where we were trained on breathing takening projects as a full-stack software engineer for 70 hours a week.

          The 12-months ALX-Africa course helped me understand data strructure and algorythm, database and system management, web achitecture and system design, task automation, creating and consuming API, bugs fixation and the importance of communication and team work.
          I enjoin solving problems and figuring things out is something i consider a "gift". I love being alone but my best mood is when i'm around people talking.
