        Out of curiosity and my love for learning new things, I started learning Python in 2019. My desire for tech skyrocketed when I created and managed a full-fledged blog site using WordPress, even though I had no knowledge of its stacks. So I decided to learn HTML & CSS, and JavaScript in 2021. Just after finishing my self-taught journey in 2022, I got an opportunity to join ALX-Africa powered by Holberton coding school in the USA, where we were trained on breathtaking projects as full-stack software engineers for 70 hours a week.

        The 12-month ALX-Africa course helped me understand data structure and algorithms, database and system management, web architecture and system design, task automation, creating and consuming APIs, bug fixing, and the importance of communication and teamwork. I enjoy solving problems and figuring things out, which is something I consider a "gift". I love being alone, but my best mood is when I'm around people talking.
